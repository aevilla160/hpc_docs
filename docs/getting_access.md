### Notebook Zero

Notebook zero typically includes a variety of subjects and is often customized for the specific course it supports. However, there are a few consistent elements found in every notebook zero.

- code and Markdown cells
- variables and Python data types (int, float, str, bool)
- arithmetic and operators
- logical operators and keywords (and, or, not)
- if/elif/else statements
- functions and builtins
- errors

Depending on the course or module, more topics may be covered (e.g. importing libraries, iteration). While these notebooks tend to be very homogeneous.

Please find the [Notebook Zero](https://github.com/SaiUCM/Jupyterhub_Docs_Instructor/blob/main/Notebook%20Zero.ipynb) which covers the above mentioned topics and it also explains how to plot the graphs using Matplotlib and Plotly libraries.
