## MERCED cluster <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

MERCED (Multi-Environment Research Computer for Exploration and
Discovery) Cluster is a 2096 core Linux based high performance computing
cluster supported by the National Science Foundation Award
ACI-1429783. The MERCED cluster runs with the [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/) operating system,
and employs the [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/) job scheduler and queueing system to manage job runs. a standard flavor of Linux, and employs the Slurm job scheduler and queueing system to manage job runs.


## MERCED recharge service (Feb. 2023) <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
!>__OIT-CIRT is in an immediate recharge hiatus, retroactive to January 1, 2022.__

The Cyber Infrastructure and Research Technologies (CIRT) team is aware that our recent move to a recharge model has been a pain point for some research groups, and we are working with the Provost’s office to obtain bridge funding to offset CIRT recharge costs for faculty. We will continue to waive all costs for faculty using CIRT recharge services, including costs for using MERCED cluster core-hours, until further notice. 

This is a fluid situation, but we anticipate that costs will be waived until further notice. Once details have been finalized, we will reach out again to inform you, and we will also provide all users with at least one month’s notice before recharges begin again. 


__Faculty PIs__: Please ensure that the user accounts are active and provide the COA# [here](https://merced-my.sharepoint.com/personal/yyu49_ucmerced_edu/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fyyu49%5Fucmerced%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2FMERCED%5Frecharge&ct=1639436999554&or=OWA%2DNT&cid=61ce730a%2D0df2%2Dd438%2D7bdf%2Dbe138cf58c23) before EOB __12/21/2021__.

What is the unit of cost service? MERCED cluster cycles will be charged by **core-hours<sup>(1)</sup>**.

(1)  A core-hour is a single compute core<sup>(2)</sup> used for one hour (a core-hour) and 2G of RAM. The total cost in core-hours for a complete computation is:
```text
Total Cost ($) = # of core-hours x Duration (wall clock hours) x (cost per core-hour)
```
!> **For UC users, the cost per core-hour is $0.01, and the cost for non-UC external users is $0.02.**

(2)  A core is an individual processor: the part of a computer that executes programs. (The MERCED cluster has about 3100 cores.)



> I don’t want to pay for MERCED what are my options?

If you stay below or at your baseline allocation, you will not incur any fees. However, you can obtain access to other free compute resources such as our new NSF-MRI Pinnacles cluster, and XSEDE resources – and my team can provide consultation for how to access these resources. Schedule a consultation here.

> I have other questions!

We have put together a FAQ page that has the most common questions received and will be keeping it up to date.

Once again, if you have any questions or concerns regarding MERCED
cluster policies. Feel free to reach schadalapaka@ucmerced.edu.
