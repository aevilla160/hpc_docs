### Using Jupyter Notebooks for Data Analysis <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

**Jupyter Notebooks** are incredibly versatile for **data analysis** projects. They allow data scientists to combine **executable code**, rich text, **visualizations**, and equations in a single document.

- **Interactive Data Exploration:** Notebooks facilitate interactive exploration of datasets, enabling quick iterations over a data preprocessing or analysis pipeline.
- **Visualization:** With support for libraries like **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**, users can create and embed graphs directly within notebooks.
- **Collaboration and Sharing:** Notebooks can be easily shared between users, promoting collaboration on data analysis projects.


## What is JupyterHub? 

[Jupyterhub](https://jupyter.org/hub) JupyterHub is an open source tool that lets you host a distributed Jupyter Notebook environment. With JupyterHub, users can log in to the server, and write Python,R code in a web browser, without having to install software on their local machine.

Working on JupyterHub provides a number of benefits, especially in an introductory course:

Students never have to do any setup or installation. JupyterHub removes the burden of setting up and maintaining a development environment.

All students and instructors use the same computing environment.

Work stored in the cloud and can be accessed from any computer.

All students have access to the same compute power, regardless of the machine they are using. For example, students without personal computers can use publicly shared computers(i.e. library computers) without being at a disadvantage in the course.

## Installing packages on the Hub

### Is it possible to install custom packages?<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Absolutely! In Jupyter Notebook, you have the flexibility to install packages using either `!pip install package-name` or `!conda install package-name` for Python packages. For R, utilize `install.packages()`. **Just remember, the packages you install only stick around while you're using the server. So, it's recommended to put the installation commands at the start of your notebook or file, making sure they run when you need them.**

### What packages & libraries are available?<!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

This JupyterHub comes with Python 3.11.4 and R 4.3.1 installed. Many commonly used packages are pre-installed. This **[requirements.txt](https://ucmerced.box.com/s/x2eigcssqyeca9mrid3m19glfcs73j02)** file lists the python packages installed, while this  **[install.R](https://ucmerced.box.com/s/65r1rda9atblpdsxdvtyaq6exlnns9z3)** file lists the R packages installed.

To inquire about packages, users should open the notebook from the launcher and type the following command:
- For Python packages: Type `pip freeze` (users should be in the python server).
- For R packages: Type `installed.packages()` (users should be in the R server).

## nbgitpuller

You’ll often want to distribute content (such as notebooks, scripts, sample data, etc.) to your users so they can do exercises, follow along with a lecture, or use as a starting point for their own work. This content is often constantly updated as time goes on, and needs to not overwrite your student’s work if you make an adjustment to content that has already been touched by the student. That’s where nbgitpuller comes into the picture.

nbgitpuller is already installed in the default environment for UCMerced JupyterHubs. To set up a nbgitpuller link, users must have a GitHub account. The following are the steps which will guide you to create an nbgitpuller link:

### Put your files in a public Github Repository <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Create a repository on GitHub and start putting your content there. This repository serves as the source of the content that will be distributed to your users. You can update it as often as needed. While instructors must understand how [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/about-github-and-git) works, your users will never have to directly interact with git.


### Generate nbgitpuller Link <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Users can generate an nbgitpuller link using the tool [nbgitpuller](https://nbgitpuller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/link.html) link, which will look like in the following screenshot:

![output_area](./imgs/nbgitpuller.png)


The following steps will explain each and every field in the screenshot below.

- A. Generated link appears here:
- B. JupyterHub URL
- C. Git Repository URL
- D. File to Open
- E. Application to Open

### Distribute your nbgitpuller link <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Distribute the link you have generated to your users. Upon clicking the link, they will be redirected to your hub and asked to log in if they have not already. 

The first time the link is clicked, your content repository will be pulled into their home directory! If they had already clicked the link before, any new changes in your content repository will be pulled in. 

Any changes the user has made will be automatically merged with changes in the content repository in such a way that the user’s changes are never overwritten. All merge conflicts will also be automatically resolved so users don’t have to interact with git. 

If you have picked a specific file to be displayed, the user will be redirected to that file, open in the application you picked. If not, the directory listing of the local copy of the content repository will be shown in the application you selected.

### How do I ensure Plotly charts render correctly in Jupyterhub? <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Ensure that you include this line in your notebook for Plotly to function properly. Referring to the documentation at 
[Plotly Renderers](https://plotly.com/python/renderers/), there are two methods to achieve this:

Import the `io` method from Plotly in your import statement: `import plotly.io as pio`, and specify the desired renderer using `pio.renderers.default = "iframe"`. 
   
   ```python
   import plotly.io as pio
   pio.renderers.default = "iframe" ```
  Alternatively, directly specify the renderer in the fig.show() method by using fig.show(renderer='iframe').
