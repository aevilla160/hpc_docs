## Recharge Center FAQs

With the new NSF-MRI Cluster Pinnacles coming online, we are transitioning the MERCED cluster to a recharge service (effective January 1, 2022).
This page has the most common questions received and will be keeping it up to date. 

> Are the costs the same regardless of whether we purchased our own nodes or not?
    
The fees apply uniformly across to the general Slurm partitions (e.g., fast.q, long.q, std.q).

>  How do we get access to the Pinnacles FREE cluster?
    
Users approved for central login access will automatically have access to the Pinnacles cluster.

> Can I purchase core-hours in advance?

As recharge services operate on a pay-per-use basis, advance purchases of core-hours are not possible. However, you have the option to acquire "condo-model" CPU/GPU compute nodes purchasing for integration into the Pinnacles cluster, ensuring seamless access to computational resources. To request a purchase of Pinnacles condo-model nodes, click [here](https://ucmerced.service-now.com/servicehub?id=public_kb_article&sys_id=3c3ee9ff1b67a0543a003112cd4bcb13&form_id=06da3f8edbfc08103c4d56f3ce9619f4).

> Can faculty charge recharge services directly to a grant?

Grant funds have restrictions on how the funding can be spent, and every grant is unique. So, as long as recharge service is allowable expense under the grant, then faculty can charge recharge services directly to the grant. Each grant has a unique COA#. Please ensure that your COA information is accurate in the MERCED recharge spreadsheet by emailing cirt@ucmerced.edu.

> I do not want my research group to exceed free core-hour limit on MERCED.

The initial recharge center implementation will provide bi-weekly usage reports of their groups to faculty PIs. 
If at any point, faculty would like for CIRT to revoke access to their group, CIRT can do so. 

> I want access to free resources. How can I get access to them?

Remember, if you stay below or at your baseline allocation, you will not incur any fees. However, you can obtain access to other free compute resources such as our new NSF-MRI Pinnacles cluster, and XSEDE resources â€“ and my team can provide consultation for how to access these resources.
