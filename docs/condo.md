# Adding PI-Owned Nodes to Pinnacles Cluster

Faculty(Primary Investigators) can seek purchasing their own nodes onto the Pinnacles Cluster. 

PI-owned nodes will be added to the Pinnacles Cluster unless a newer cluster is anticipated to be in production within a reasonable time frame determined by CIRT. 

When contributing nodes to the public cluster, it is expected that CIRT will house and maintain these nodes in the cluster for as long as they are under warranty.


## Other Associated Costs

Other associated costs will be determined upon consultations with CIRT team. Costs  < ASK CIRT later>


## Condo Model for Pinnacles process

1. Providing consultation, determining the appropriate hardware
2. Work with CIRT and our primary vendor ACT to obtain the associated quotes
3. Once the quotes have been obtained and given to the PI, PI will have to work with their respective departments to purchase the hardware. CIRT asks that the PI keeps us in the loop for any questions regarding shipping and recieving and other associated tasks. 

## Queue Priority

1. Users in the associated group(s) will be given the highest priority on the associated partition to run jobs on the node(s). 
2. Users in the associated group(s) will have access to the specific partition to access the node(s) dependent on SLURMS queuing reource parameters. 
3. CIRT will allow all users to be placed on the PI-Owned node for up to one hour via the test partition.

## Warranty

The PI-owned node once it is out of warranty, CIRT will give the PI two options: 

1. CIRT Keeps the node(s) and merge to public partition - 

    ``` 
    CIRT compensates PI group usage on Pinnacles for up to one year. 
    PI-owned queues will cease to exist and and the nodes will be merged into general, public partition(s).
    CIRT will set up a condo-QOS for PI groups to have a higher priority on queues for one year after the node is removed. 

    CIRT will take responsibility for the maintance and housing of the node post-warranty. CIRT will also reserve the right to retire the node(s) that are out of warranty and has associated costs(staff time, power, cooling, and machine room space)
    ```
2. CIRT returns the node to the PI?? 

    ```
    CIRT will facilitate removing the PI nodes from the cluster
    PIs might incur costs for CIRT's time and effort on this
    PI will be soley responslbe for the node's maintance once returned.
