## How To Request Support and Assitance <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

When requesting support or seeking assistance there are two main forms of request, attending office hours or submitting a ticket. 
Information about office hours location, schedule and Q/A can be found [here](office_hours.md)!

Note: Please do not try to directly contact CIRT Staff for Assistance. Requests through this manner will not be assitanted immediately. 

### Requesting Assistance - Via Ticket <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Submitting a ticket is the primary method HPC users can request support.

### Prior to requesting support: <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
It is important for users to conduct research and exhaust all other sources to find or troubleshoot their question or concern. It is always try to do a quick search with the exact error message or other message produced by the software. It is also good to formulate questions about the issue you are having into more concise phrases. 
> How do I run a parallel script acrooss many nodes?

Change this format to:
> Running a parallel job across node.

It is always better to type in phrases than questions when searching for answers or help as phrases allow for much wider sources to be shown to you; whereas, questions will force the search to try to find exact or similar questions to be found that may or may not have the exact same factors that is present on the current enviroment. 

### Writing a Good Request via a Ticket <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
Here are steps and tips on how to write a good request via a ticket when requesting support from CIRT. It is important to remember that submitting a ticket is the main method users can recieve support from CIRT. CIRT is a small team so when requesting support please allow 3-5 business days to recieve a response from us. 

### Tips <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

1. Users should use the central Ticket hub to submit all tickets. Click [here](https://ucmerced.service-now.com/servicehub?id=public_kb_article&sys_id=3c3ee9ff1b67a0543a003112cd4bcb13&form_id=06da3f8edbfc08103c4d56f3ce9619f4) to access page. 

2. Provide a specific description about what is happening and try to include as many details and key error messages or prompts being presented
    - It is best to  copy and paste the **EXACT** messages or errors that are being encountered into the ticket. It saves time and unnessary communication. Please also indicate which server you were running on, and working directory, so that it is easier for the CIRT staff to navigate to the folder and solve the issue. 

3. Include description about the current enviroment and what is working currently on the step or process in the situation.
    - Are you running custom-compiled code? Which modules are loaded? Are you running software that was self-downloaded? Custom Conda Enviroment? These are a couple of items that if applicable should be stated in the ticket as it helps us recreate the correct enviroment to more easily and quickly resolve the issue. 

4. Create a new ticket for new issues that arrise. 
    - For every new unrelated or related issue that arrises, it is important to create new and seperate tickets as it allows for CIRT to properly allocate the time and resources to the issues. Once a ticket is closed it can not be re-opened. 

5. Simple Issues
    - Even the simplest of issues may still require lots of time and effort to be put in to be resolved. Even if it appears to be a simple issue, please attach all information that pertains to the issue as stated in tip 2 and 3. 

6. Complex issues
    - For complex issues, please create an example that we can copy, paste and run which demonstrates the problem. We do not have the time to run huge-complex pieces of codes or jobs to test for an issue. It is important that when requesting support on a complex problem that you include as lots of details in a clear and concise manner. If an example is being included on the ticket ensure that it is small and fast. Please remember that the more complex the issue is, the more time and communication needed to resolve, so it is expected full cooperation and patience as we try to help all users in a efficient manner.
