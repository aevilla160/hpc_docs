# Cyberinfrastructure and Research Technologies <!-- {docsify-ignore-all} -->


UC Merced's [Cyberinfrastructure
and Research Technologies (CIRT)](https://it.ucmerced.edu/CIRT) team strives to bring research
computing, high-speed networking, and advanced visualization to campus
researchers across all disciplines. CIRT's mission is to foster a research environment where scholars effortlessly navigate across computational tiers, supported by cutting-edge technological solutions and educational resources. Serving as a reliable and strategic ally to the university's research cohort, we construct resilient cyberinfrastructure to enhance the institution's research endeavors.

## We are here to help you!

We can help you use supercomputers to work faster, visualize the complexity of your data to work smarter, and collaborate across campus or around the world for broader impacts. We utilize approaches that are flexible enough to accommodate your needs, while still adhering to best-practices which are proven to be effective. We can help you manage the complex relationship between you and the computing technology you use to advance your work.


## Free trainings!

## Research computing facility statement
Computational faculty and computational facilities are located in a number of current buildings on UC Merced's main campus.  Main campus classrooms and research space used for faculty/student offices, meetings, retreats, seminars, are workshops are located in Science and Engineering I (SE1), Science and Engineering 2 (SE2), the Classroom and Office Building (COB), Classroom and Office Building 2 (COB2), Arts and Computational Sciences Building (ACS), and the Social Science and Management Building (SSM). UC Merced's 2020 Project (see http:// merced2020.ucmerced.edu for details) is currently growing the campus at a rapid pace, roughly doubling the University's usable square footage over the three-year period 2017-2020.
 
The Research Computing Facility, named the Borg Cube, is a 1,448 square foot pre-manufactured, self-contained, fully serviceable data center-style building comprised of two (2) transportable modular containers, one section for electrical distribution and the other to house research computing machines. The design includes three (3) 60-ton Indirect Evaporative Cooling (IEC) mechanical units to be located outside, adjacent to the structure. The Borg Cube houses twenty (20) 19"-24" racks with 51U per rack, totaling 1020U and provides 400kW of N+1 redundant power capacity at the rack bus, providing the ability to provide individual racks with either redundant or non-redundant power supply units. The design includes two (2) 500kVA PDU's each fed from separate sources backed up from dedicated 500kVA UPS which are connected to two (2) 800A rated Starline bus to account for single or dual corded customer connections. An N+1 UPS system will consist of two (2) 500kVA UPS units, each to be equipped with batteries to support its full load for 15 minutes. The mechanical design includes three (3) 60-ton IEC units totaling 633kW of cooling available. This design accounts for an additional unit (N+1), in the case of maintenance or failure of an operating unit. The design technical requirements do not list the requirement for an N+1 mechanical system as this building can be fully supported by two (2) 60-ton units; however, due to the importance of this facility, the third unit exists for operations and maintenance purposes. This approach gives the facility engineers the ability to provide maintenance on a given unit without shutting down the facility and limiting unnecessary down time. A self-contained FM-200 style suppression system along with the required detection devices are provided for fire protection and detection systems. One (1) FM-200 tank is provided for each individual module. A VESDA system is present to detect smoke at its earliest stage and to send a signal to the clean agent suppression panel. Two (2) 1500kva substations based on an N+1 design, are provided to accept separate services. Each substation is provided with a 2000A main breaker, a 1000A breaker for the current facility, and an open space for a future circuit breaker to be used to support a potential future expansion. One of the substations is provided with a 100A breaker for the electrical equipment serving the site loads.
