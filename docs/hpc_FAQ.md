## General HPC Questions

> __How do I make a General Request/Consultation?🤔__

OIT provides general request services or for assessments for individuals and research groups who wish to deploy research computing and advanced cyberinfrastructure techniques (e.g. high-performance computing, visualization, advanced networking and data collaboration, and advanced technology-enhanced workflow development).
You can make a General Request/Consultation [here](https://ucmerced.service-now.com/servicehub?id=public_kb_article&sys_id=3c3ee9ff1b67a0543a003112cd4bcb13&form_id=06da3f8edbfc08103c4d56f3ce9619f4).


> __How to include CIRT managed charged services into budget statement?__

The faculties plan to include the budget for CIRT-managed charged services in the budget statement. Please list it under the category of 'Other Direct Costs.' For example, purchased HPC storage services can be allocated to the 'Materials/Supplies: MERCED HPC storage and maintenance' category within the 'Other Direct Costs' section. Here is the sample <a href="./files/Budget_Justification_NIH Data_Management_And_Sharing_Justification.pdf" download="Budget_Justification_NIH Data_Management_And_Sharing_Justification.pdf">NIH data management documentations</a> and <a href="./files/Budget Justification Detailed.pdf" download="Budget Justification Detailed.pdf">budget justification</a>

> __When/where are the HPC Walk-in Clinic hours?__

Bring your laptop, your code and your questions to the clinic and get expert help, right on the spot. Experienced graduate students are encouraged to come help your peers by mentoring them in HPC tips and tricks. Faculty are also welcome to join. Among others, Yue Yu (Sr. Research Computing Facilitator) will be available to meet with and help members of the campus research computing community at these sessions.

> __How do I change password on research cluster?__
* You can request for changing your password on MERCED/any CIRT managed research cluster by submitting a general research request [here](https://ucmerced.service-now.com/servicehub?id=public_kb_article&sys_id=3c3ee9ff1b67a0543a003112cd4bcb13&form_id=06da3f8edbfc08103c4d56f3ce9619f4).
* Please provide the name (and/or IP address) of the cluster on which you need your password updated.

>__Error Logging into research cluster/ error sshing into cluster__

* When accessing the research clusters from an off-campus location, please ensure you are logged into UC Merced VPN to access your research cluster. VPN allows faculty, students and staff to connect to research computing resources from home or other off campus networks.

* If you still run into errors logging into the cluster, please submit a general research request [here](https://ucmerced.service-now.com/servicehub?id=public_kb_article&sys_id=3c3ee9ff1b67a0543a003112cd4bcb13&form_id=06da3f8edbfc08103c4d56f3ce9619f4).

> __I am a student in a PI group. How can I request for Pinnacles and/or MERCED  cluster access?__

You can start the [step-1](https://ucmerced.service-now.com/servicehub?id=public_kb_article&sys_id=3c3ee9ff1b67a0543a003112cd4bcb13&form_id=06da3f8edbfc08103c4d56f3ce9619f4) access process, but in order to receive an account, you need approval from a UC Merced PI. Every account on Pinnacles is associated with that of a faculty PI. If you are requesting MERCED cluster access you must attach a valid COA number, to the ticket process, this COA number is usually distributed by the PI. 

> __I am a student who changed PIs do I need to update my PI information?__

Yes, submit a [ticket](https://ucmerced.service-now.com/servicehub?id=public_kb_article&sys_id=3c3ee9ff1b67a0543a003112cd4bcb13&form_id=06da3f8edbfc08103c4d56f3ce9619f4) to update your PI and to change user groups. 

> __My access request for Pinnacles and/or MERCED was denied – what are my next steps?__

CIRT can schedule a consultation with the faculty to specifically address the comments from Committee on Research Computing (CoRC).

> __I have several users doing different projects, can I use different COA# for them?__

Yes, please make sure keep the COA# information updated. Each user can also have different COA#, if the user is doing multiple projects. If you have any questions, feel free to open a ticket [here](https://ucmerced.service-now.com/servicehub?id=public_kb_article&sys_id=3c3ee9ff1b67a0543a003112cd4bcb13&form_id=06da3f8edbfc08103c4d56f3ce9619f4).


> __How do I move Big Data?__

*Visit our [Data Transfer](data_transfer.md) to get more information on transfering Big Data. 


>__I want access to free resources. How can I get access to them?__

Remember, if you stay below or at your baseline allocation, you will not incur any fees. However, you can obtain access to other free compute resources such as our new NSF-MRI Pinnacles cluster, and XSEDE resources – and my team can provide consultation for how to access these resources. Schedule a consultation [here](https://arrangr.com/sarvani/rechargemeeting).



## Pinnacles - Questions


> __I am in the process of purchasing a condo-model nodes for Pinnacles, do I have to go through the access process?__

No

>__I am a UC Merced PI, but my collaborators are not from UC Merced, how do I request Pinnacles access to my collaborator ?__

All accounts on Pinnacles cluster need to be associated with that of a UC Merced faculty PI. If your collaborator is a non-UC Merced collaborator, then, they would need a UC Merced NetID to access VPN and login to Pinnacles cluster. Usually, department MSOs provide UC Merced NetIDs for collaborators.


## MERCED - Questions

>__Are the costs the same regardless of whether we purchased our own nodes or not?__

The costs and the charges are for general Slurm partitions and not for PI-owned partitions (example: amartini.q, dstrubbe.q, qsb.q, skhatri3.q). That is, if users/groups purchased nodes for MERCED and are submitting jobs on PI/Group owned queues, users will not be charged for core-hours.

>__Can I purchase core-hours in advance?__

Since recharge services are pay-per-use services, users cannot purchase core-hours in advance. However, you can purchase “condo-model” CPU/GPU compute node(s) for Pinnacles for seamless access to compute resources after Jan 1, 2022. Request for a Pinnacles condo-model purchase [here](https://ucmerced.service-now.com/servicehub?id=public_kb_article&sys_id=3c3ee9ff1b67a0543a003112cd4bcb13&form_id=06da3f8edbfc08103c4d56f3ce9619f4).

>__Can faculty charge recharge services directly to a grant?__

Grant funds have restrictions on how the funding can be spent, and every grant is unique. So, as long as recharge service is allowable expense under the grant, then faculty can charge recharge services directly to the grant. Each grant has a unique COA#. Please ensure that your COA information is accurate in the MERCED recharge spreadsheet that was sent to faculty to fill out in the year 2021.

>__I do not want my research group to exceed free core-hour limit on MERCED__

The initial recharge center implementation will provide bi-weekly usage reports of their groups to faculty PIs. If at any point, faculty would like for CIRT to stop MERCED cluster access to their group, please send an email to cirt@ucmerced.edu and CIRT can stop access. 


## Job/Software - Questions

> __How do I install software on a CIRT Managed cluster?__

* If the software package or version you need is not available in the list of provided software, you may compile and install it yourself. The recommended location for user-installed software is the $HOME path.
* If the software installation requires root (sudo) access and/or if you need further assistance installing the software, you can request service [here](https://ucmerced.service-now.com/servicehub?id=public_kb_article&sys_id=b83ee9ff1b67a0543a003112cd4bcbde&form_id=0cb3dca04f7d4300b52ba1618110c7ff).

> __My Jobs are running unusually slow, failing with errors, I need to cancel a currently running job__

Jobs can be running unusually slow for many reasons that can be relating to the about number of tasks asigned to the job, number of nodes, and the memory being allocated to the job. These three factors are just a few common factors that can be leading to an unusually slow job, and all of these are dependent on what is being computed(i.e. a parralel python script or a simple list of unix commands). It is important to understand what the code is  anticpated to execute and how that will be done with the resources you are requesting. This will allow for the user to better less/more computing resources to get the computations/calculations done in an effecient manner. 

To get information about troubleshooting a job failing with errors visit our [Job Management Page](Manage_job.md)

To cancel a job: `scancel <jobid>` or `skill <jobid>`
