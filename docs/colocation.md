# Colocation Services for Research Computing

CIRT operates a data center in SE1 and SE2 for colocation use by college and departmental IT units and researchers. Faculty and staff authorized by each occupying unit will have access to the facility. The policies governing the facility and the costs associated with occupancy are outlined below.

## Colocation Defintion and Service
CIRT provides colocation service where PIs  can pay for space to house their physical servers and other computing hardware. Colocation service provides PIs professional maintance and oversight to their computing resources as the data center rooms are maintained, secure and climate controlled. This allows for researchers and faculty to not have to spend funds on housing the computing resources and allows for them to focus more the computing power and research. 


### CIRT provides the following one-time services in a PI managed colocation service.

### Colocation Duration

Colocation Service Level Agrrements Must be reviewed by the PI and CIRT together atleast once a year. 


## Colocation Facilities 
### Security and acceptable use of the facility and equipment

Access to the facility is not transferable from one Occupant to another, however guests may accompany an authorized occupant following CIRT security guidelines. Because it is a shared space, the facility, it is the responsibility of each occupant to ensure that their personnel do not interfere with the operation of other equipment. Occupants are not permitted to use or interact with network, power and cooling infrastructure outside of their own racks. Access under the raised floor and over the drop ceiling is prohibited.

**Science and Engineering 1** and **Science and Engineering 2** server rooms are the two colocations offered to faculty and other UC Merced affiliates.
